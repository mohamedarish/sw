# Contributing to `sw`

sw is a small and not very feature filled clone of the unix command `ls`

## Styling and formatting

Code is formatted using rustfmt and linted using clippy
You can install these with

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy
```

Make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed
